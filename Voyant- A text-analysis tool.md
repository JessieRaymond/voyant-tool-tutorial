# Voyant: A text-analysis tool

Voyant is a powerful tool that can be used for analyzing text.  In this tutorial we will look at Voyant: what it is, details on how to use a few of its many features, and why it can be useful for humanities research.  

(Voyant)[http://voyant-tools.org] runs online so it is not necessary to download any software.  To begin, you can either upload a text file or paste in a text or link, then click 'reveal'.  For this tutorial, we will be looking at (The Travels of Marco Polo)[https://archive.org/stream/marcopolo00polouoft/marcopolo00polouoft_djvu.txt].

### Understanding and Using Voyant's Interface
Once Voyant has 'revealed' your chosen text, it will look something like this:

The text will be on the right while the left has a word cloud and statistics for the most frequent words within the text.  For our text, the words 'of', 'the', 'and' and 'in' were the most frequent.  Those words do not elucidate much about the text.  A good first step after inputting a corpus into Voyant is to clean it up a little.

To start, hit the cog in the left-hand corner next to 'Cirrus' to get the search options.  Here, you can edit the 'stop-words', the words which will not be taken into consideration in the text analysis.  You can manually put in words as well as choose from preexisting lists, depending on the language.  For English, the Taporware list exists.  Click the box 'Apply Stop Words Globally' and then click ok.

A new word cloud should appear.  Now for our text, the words 'city', 'country', 'great', 'grand' and 'khan' are the most frequent and reveal a lot more about the text than the previous list had.

### How to do some other thing Voyant can do


### Exporting Data
Voyant can be used to manipulate texts and extract key elements, which can then be exported for use in other programs.  We will go over one example this by looking at how to use the RezoViz feature to create a .net file ready for network analysis in a program like Gephi(link to it).  

(Note to self: include a strong warning about how it might make your computer freeze/unresponsive/bad/blink in a way that isn't good for epileptics)

### Conclusion and Thoughts on Voyant's disparate and powerful uses


This is obviously a mess but it has some framework and all the potential!
